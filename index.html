    <h2>What was challenging about Assignment 4:</h2>
    <p>
      There were several things I thought were challenging completing Assignment
      4:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up the server.</li>
      <li>The posts/n page.</li>
      <li>Serving the CSS, Javascript, and Benny picture.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What I learned:</h2>
    <p>
      I found a
      <a
        href="https://medium.com/developerhelps/getelementbyid-display-none-faf96b4d24b0"
        >YoutTube video</a
      >
      that helped me set up the server using the HTTP node.js library
    </p>

    <p>
      It took me a while to figure out how to serve the posts/n page. It took
      some talking with <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> to learn
      that I had to use req.url.substring and the isNaN function to test if n
      was a valid number.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hardest part of this assignment for me was serving style.css,
      index.js, and benny.jpg. At first, I didn't realize that I had to set up
      responses for those files and tried to include them when serving my html
      files. I was really confused with
      <a href="google.com">Google</a> and
      <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT's</a> answers, and ended up
      having an aha moment and figuring the solution on my own.
